# Xotix Car Finder
---
A web app that helps bring together buyers and sellers of vintage and exotic cars. Unlike other car search sites, information regarding the type of car the buyer is interested in is gathered upon signup. Then any and all matches are automatically presented on the buyers dashboard, no more entering in search criteria each time you visit this site. When the buyer finds a car they like, they can request the seller contact them to get more details about the car and settle on a price.
